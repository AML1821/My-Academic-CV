### Welcome
Welcome to my professional portfolio!  


I’m a researcher, instructor, and PhD student in the **Texts & Technology** program at the University of Central Florida.  


My work explores how digital tools, AI-assisted writing, and reflective practice shape the teaching and learning of writing in higher education. This site highlights my research interests, publications, and teaching experience. It also serves as a digital space for my ongoing academic and professional projects.

### About Me
I am passionate about exploring how writers learn to transfer knowledge across contexts—academic, digital, and professional. My background in **Teacher Training** and **Writing and Rhetoric** has guided my work in developing student-centered, reflective writing practices that embrace emerging technologies responsibly. I am actively exploring research fellowship opportunities through UCF’s Institute of Artificial Intelligence to advance my work in AI-assisted writing and digital literacies. 


I currently serve as a **Graduate Research Assistant** at UCF and as an **Adjunct Instructor of English Composition** teaching courses emphasizing critical reflection and rhetorical awareness.
