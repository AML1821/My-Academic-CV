### 🌟 Welcome
Welcome to my professional portfolio!  
I’m a researcher, instructor, and PhD student in the **Texts & Technology** program at the University of Central Florida.  
My work explores how digital tools, AI-assisted writing, and reflective practice shape the teaching and learning of writing in higher education.  

This site highlights my research interests, publications, and teaching experience. It also serves as a digital space for my ongoing academic and professional projects.

### 📘 About Me
I am passionate about exploring how writers learn to transfer knowledge across contexts—academic, digital, and professional.  
My background in **English Composition** and **Writing and Rhetoric** has guided my work in developing student-centered, reflective writing practices that embrace emerging technologies responsibly.  

I currently serve as a **Graduate Research Assistant** at UCF and as an **Adjunct Instructor of English Composition** at South College in Orlando, where I teach courses emphasizing critical reflection and rhetorical awareness.
